# Florin Pop's App Ideas Collection - Chat App React Project

This is a solution to [Chat App React Project of Florin Pop's App Ideas Collection](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/3-Advanced/Chat-App.md). Florin Pop is a Developer and Content Creator, who loves to build In Public while motivating and encouraging others to follow their dreams. I'm trying to improve my coding skills by building realistic React Projects through his list.

## Overview

### The Challenge/User Stories
  
The objective of this project is to build a Real-time chat interface where multiple users can interact with each other by sending messages.  

This challenge requires that the developer implementing it follow these constraints:
-  User is prompted to enter a username when he visits the chat app. The username will be stored in the application.  
-  User can see an input field where he can type a new message.  
-  User can edit and delete messages.  
-  By pressing the enter key or by clicking on the send button the text will be displayed in the chat box alongside his username (e.g. John Doe: Hello World!).

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- React.js

### What I learned

- Usual methodology employed: First built project using Vanilla Javascript (necessary files are named "zuri" in the public folder), then did it all over again using React. Reasoning being to better practically understand how React differs from Vanilla JavaScript. 
- Initially wanted to add 2 additional functionalities to this. Authentication with Auth0, and cloud storage with Firebase. But this project kicked my ass so much so will save the add-ons probably for the next project.
- Truth remains however that Practice makes perfect. This stuff that's tasking my brain, in time to come when I get more familiar will be concluding same stuff in zero time. And even advanced/harder variations at that!
- ChatGPT was massive with this one. Interpreting the logic to code was frequently tough, but ChatGPT always came through with the right prompts (Most particularly in the React rebuild).  

### Continued development

- Keep going till you get first Tech job. Giving up is never an option!
